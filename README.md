# polygon-area-calculator
Completed in part for freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python Course. 

This project defines a class called Rectangle, which takes arguments of height and width. The class contains methods to calculate the area, perimeter, and diagonal. In addition to these methods, it also contains methods to alter the height and width of the rectangle, and a method that can be used to draw the rectangle to the screen in the console using asterisks. 

This project also contains a subclass of Square, which contains the same methods as the rectangle class, but takes only one argument of length. 

Finally, the class contains a method that calculates how many of another given shape, provided as an argument, can fit with the given shape. This calculation does not calculate rotations of the other argument shape.
