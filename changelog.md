Code passed the test! Just got rid of some old comments and placed new ones that actually describe the code. Going to merge w/ main branch after this push.

Thought it passed the ex. test, turns out it doesn't, seems to be an error in the draw shape method (need a new line at the end), also some errors w/ returning square

Finished writing the class and subclass. Ran test code and discovered where some errors exist. Committing prior to fixing errors.

Started the project. Working on the shape inside of shape function. Currently an error exists, but also, the function is not complete yet. Nothing has been tested yet. Committing and pushing prior to work.
